# Offensive security

## Sharing is caring, right ?

### Wait, an another security gitbook/blog/younameit ?

For years, i was using the excellent [cherrytree](https://www.giuspen.com/cherrytree/), trying to document pretty much everything i do/install/test. I guess this is the way it works the best for me.

Being influenced by so many amazing people on the internet who are sharing their knowledge \(and because my cherrytree is going to explode one day ... \), i just decided to share my own personal notes \(well, just a part of it ... it takes a lot of time and i still have a lot to transfert ...\). 

The goal is just to provide a technical guide which can \(or not\) be useful to other people.

### Disclaimer

Most of the researches and techniques documented here are not mine \(i try to provide resources links every time can\) and i don't have any ownership on it. 

Ping me if needed :\)

Also, note that there are probably a lot of mistakes/missing things, don't take everything for granted.
