# Remote Code injection

## Remote Code injection

### Basic

Remote Code injection is \(in general\) a 3 ways process:

From a malicious process, we can inject code to an another process \(ie migration\).

### 1. Allocate Memory into the remote process.

This can be done using the `VirtualProcessEx` Windows API. The dropper will create an empty buffer on the remote process.

### 2. Copy the shellcode on the remote process

Basicaly copy the shellcode into the remote allocated buffer using `WriteProcessMemory` Windows API

### 3. Execute the shellcode

Execute the shellcode copied using `CreateRemoteThread` Windows API
