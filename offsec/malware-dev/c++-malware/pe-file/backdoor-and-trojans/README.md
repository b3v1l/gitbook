# Backdooring PE files

## Backdooring PE files

### Implementation methods

* Code cave \(space, text section\)
  * Downside: limited place \(few bytes\)
* New section \(best option\)
  * Downside: must be set as Executable, getting cough by AV.
* Extending section \(increase the size \)
  * Downside: lot of effort
* **Note**: different methods can be used at the same time, ie, small code in the code cave to load something from new section \(which will not require to be set as Executable\).

#### Can be used to backdoor files for privilege escalation

User have RW access to a share: backdoor the exec, an another user may be using it later.
