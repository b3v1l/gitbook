# AWS Dangling Domain

## AWS Dangling Domain

Possible with AWS because of the elastic IP range.

#### Issue :

One company own an EC2 instance with is registered on a DNS server. The EC2 instance get deleted or whatever.

If we are able to find such case during enumeration, we can maybe set up our own EC2 instance using the registered IP.

### Bing Enumeration

Since BING store results for IP addresses associated with domains, it is possible to enumerate Dangling Domains :

### Proof of concept 

* Search for elastic ip in bing using the following keywords :

`ip:elastic_ip_here` `ip:8.8.8.8`

* If a result is returned \(registered IP but host down\) we can set up a webserver o0r a SMTP server to attack something else using the hijacked domain
