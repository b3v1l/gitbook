# Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE)

## Overview

*   can be used to invalidate token before they get expired. Useful in case of

    * user termination or password
    * blocking usage of token outside the trusted location (if location based conditioanl is possible)


*   To work, CAE needs a client (e.g. Web Browser, CLI, APP...) to be CAE-capable :&#x20;

    this means that the client has to understand that the token is not expired BUT is not usable anymore.

```
In a JWT, ,"xms_cc":["CP1"] means that the client CAE capable
```

> Teams, Office, oneDrive are few examples of CAE-capable.
