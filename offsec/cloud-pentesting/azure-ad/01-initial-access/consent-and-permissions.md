# Consent and Permissions

## Abuse user consent

> Applications can be used to ask users for permissions to access their data.
>
> In basic cases (such as **basic sign-in)**, if a user grant consent to an application, it will only consent for "**Low Impact**" permissions. Otherwise, an admin consent will also be required
>
> In a nutshell, if the organization allows user consent for apps, an employee can grant access to a malicious App to read :&#x20;
>
> * openid
> * profile
> * email
> * User.Read
> * Offline\_acess
>
> Some "Low Impact" permissions can be interresting, for instance User.ReadBasic.All will allow the App to read the display name, name, email address, open extensions and photo for all users.
